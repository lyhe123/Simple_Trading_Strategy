SimplePairsStrategy is a sample strategy for implementing a basic pairs trading algorithm.

Pairs trading is a reversionary strategy that looks for the pricing relationship between two correlated 
securities to diverge from its historical norm. When this happens the strategy goes long the instrument 
that is relatively cheaper than normal, and hedges by shorting the other instrument. This simple 
implementation measures the price ratio of two instruments every ten seconds, and when this price ratio 
is high compared to the 15 observation rolling sample of data, shorts the pair, if it's low goes long the pair, 
and otherwise stays out of the market. For simplicity it sends market orders (and assumes they get filled), 
and it hedges 1:1 in share count. SimplePairsStrategy defines parameters that lets the user control how many 
shares to carry for each of the symbols, for how many standard deviations from normal the ratio has to be 
before entering a position, and to toggle logging statements to the Strategy Manager."
